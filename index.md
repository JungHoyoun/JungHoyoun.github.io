## Focus

- LLM pretraining and training-systems optimization for dense and MoE foundation models.
- GPU kernel work with CUDA, CUTLASS, Triton, and Megatron-LM integration paths.
- Distributed training profiling across communication, activation memory, bandwidth, and kernel hotspots.
- Evaluation workflow improvements that shorten the feedback loop between experiments and training recipes.

## Selected Work

### Non-gated MoE activation fusion

Extended the QuACK/Sonic-MoE path so non-gated activations such as `squared_relu` can use a fused backward path rather than a chain of separate PyTorch operations. The work reduced memory access overhead and showed up to `1.25x` dgrad speedup against a `torch.compile` baseline.

### Fused linear cross entropy for Megatron-LM

Implemented a Hopper-oriented fused linear cross entropy path using CUTLASS/CuTe ideas to avoid materializing full vocabulary logits during LLM pretraining. In the benchmark shape used for Qwen-style 30B-A3B training, the work reduced activation memory by `72%` against the Triton baseline.

### Foundation-model pretraining systems

Worked on KT Foundation LLM pretraining, including dense/MoE training setup, distributed configuration tuning, profiling-led bottleneck analysis, and native evaluation workflows for faster quality feedback.
